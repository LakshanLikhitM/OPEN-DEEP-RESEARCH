Did you know there are different levels? This video for kids discusses how people use AI and outlines some of the the pros and cons of using it. \\n\\nIf you have used Siri or Google Assistant, or asked a question to Alexa, then you are using a form of artificial intelligence. These all use voice recognition and machine learning to answer questions and respond to requests. If you have ever contacted customer service online to get help, then more than likely, your conversation began with a chatbot, a computer-designed program that simulates human conversation. Chatbots were not always considered AI because they could not learn or adapt. However, chatbots have recently become more sophisticated and are increasingly using the power of AI learning.\\n\\nThere are several beneficial uses for AI, and even more when you pair AI with robotics. For example, we are automating tasks that are unsafe for humans, like mixing toxic chemicals. Many of the products we use today incorporate some form of AI in making the products. But AI is expensive, it can be weaponized, and it can result in the loss of jobs for humans, among other things. While none of us can predict the future, AI is here. What we cannot do is overestimate the power of good or underestimate the potential for disaster. Do the pros outweigh the cons? You'll have to decide!\\n\\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about artificial intelligence!
